# Mike Key (aka 1337Hero)

20+ year senior dev: Shipping fast, reliable web apps while dodging hype cycles. Full-time freelancer, indie builder, and 3x dad—blending code with real life (real estate, off-grid adventures, old books, and fitness).

## What I Do

I own the full stack: From frontends to self-hosted infrastructure. Built systems for hospitality, real estate, telecom and B2B marketing—handling architecture, deployment, and optimization end-to-end. No "prompt monkey" here; now I teach indies how to 10× with AI like a seasoned engineer.

## Key Projects

- **[FasterChat.ai](https://fasterchat.ai)**: Blazing-fast, self-hosted AI chat frontend. Offline-first, works with Ollama/Groq/OpenAI. (GitHub: [faster-chat](https://github.com/1337hero/faster-chat))
- **[Prestlo.com](https://prestlo.com)**: Invoicing tool that doesn't suck—streamlined for freelancers and indies. (In stealth; more soon.)
- **[Talos](https://github.com/1337hero/talos)**: Rust CLI for scanning codebases and generating JSON summaries. Perfect for feeding context to LLMs in large projects.
- Other builds: Custom TTS integrations, full-stack real estate dashboards, and experiments ditching the cloud for VPS freedom.

## Current Focus

Freelancing via 1337Hero: Delivering frontend/full-stack solutions for clients who want ownership, not outsourcing headaches. Sharing AI workflows for indie devs—weekly threads on X every Tuesday.
