# Mike Key (aka 1337Hero)

Frontend developer with 20+ years building fast, maintainable web applications.  
I work with React, WordPress, and full-stack infrastructure to ship reliable solutions.

## What I Do

I build and deploy production web applications—from React frontends to WordPress sites to the servers they run on. I've worked across hospitality, real estate, and B2B marketing systems, typically handling everything from initial architecture to deployment and optimization.

**Stack:** React, TypeScript, WordPress, PHP, Node.js, Linux servers, Caddy, Vercel  
**Approach:** Deep work sessions, clean code, efficient deployment pipelines

## Current Work

Freelancing through my company 1337 Hero, focused on frontend development and full-stack solutions for clients who need someone to own the entire technical delivery—not just write code.
